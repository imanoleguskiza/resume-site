Hi all,

I'm Imanol Eguskiza, a 28 year old web developer from the [Basque Country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basque_Country_(greater_region)).

I've been developing web applications since I finished my masters degree on computer science in Bilbao, mainly as a full stack Drupal developer.

After a brief affair with Java and the Vaadin framework during my college years I moved to Brussels looking for a career and I learned about Drupal and started building my first sites. I quickly started getting involved in the community and grew very fond of the open source world.

My main role has been that of a back-end developer although I have also been tasked with various other jobs like front-end developing, defining requirements, defining migration plans and managing projects.
I am a swift and able learner and have quickly and efficiently adapted to the requirements of different work environments and teams across different companies.
